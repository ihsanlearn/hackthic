## Key Features

### Reconnaissance Workflow

A structured methodology guiding operatives from initial subdomain enumeration to content discovery.

- **Subdomain Enumeration**: Integrated workflows for `subfinder`, `amass`, `dnsx`.
- **Port Scanning & Probing**: Command generators for `naabu` and `httpx`.
- **Content Discovery**: Strategies using `katana`, `gau`, and `waybackurls`.

### Global Search & Command Palette

A Spotlight-style command center (`Cmd+K`) to instantly navigate the entire ecosystem.

- **Unified Index**: Search across Tools, Payloads, Dorks, and Pages simultaneously.
- **Categorized Results**: Clear distinction between navigation, tool definitions, and payload libraries.

### Tools Center

A curated arsenal of security tools organized by phase.

- **Categories**: Proxy, Recon, Scanning, Fuzzing, Exploitation, OSINT.
- **Tool Cards**: Detailed usage instructions, categories, and quick-access documentation for tools like `Burp Suite`, `Fuzzuli`, `Dalfox`, etc.

### Payload Library

An extensive repository of attack vectors for various vulnerabilities.

- **Vulnerability Classes**: XSS, SQL Injection, LFI, SSRF, Command Injection.
- **Quick Copy**: One-click copying for rapid deployment during engagements.

### Advanced Dorking

Multi-engine dorking automation for targeted intelligence gathering.

- **Supported Engines**: Google, GitHub, Shodan, Fofa, Censys, Hunter.how.
- **Visit Tracking**: Tracks utilized dorks during a session to prevent redundancy.
- **Categories**: Bug Bounty specific files, sensitive exposures, broad reconnaissance.

### Reporting Module

Markdown-based reporting engine for documenting findings.

- **Live Preview**: Real-time rendering of markdown reports (GFM supported).
- **Templates**: Pre-built templates for common findings.
